# THE ACCELEROMETER (IN MICROBIT)
##### -an instrument for measuring the acceleration of a moving object.
##### -determines the movment of the North, South, East, West.

## WHAT WE HAVE DONE TODAY:
##### -Microbits can measure the speed, using the built in accelerometer. 
##### -We also created the microbit so when it dropped, it would display an image.
##### -We also looked at how the microbit can work as a compass, making the microbit display 'N' when tilted north.
